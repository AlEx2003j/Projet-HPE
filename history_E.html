                            Bitcoin is the first completely virtual currency, it officially appeared on October 30, 2008 with the publication of the "white paper" which is the starting point of the Bitcoin project. Its creator is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, we do not know who he is, he remained very discreet. Bitcoin is based on blockchain technology, which is a digital "ledger" that makes the project viable. Because Bitcoin is a completely virtual currency, it is not subject to the control of central banks such as the FED or the ECB, but it also escapes state control. The project has no intermediaries and is regulated solely by itself. One of the big advantages of Bitcoin is its simplicity, in fact it is accessible by everyone and everywhere provided that they have an internet connection.

                        <p class="about__description"><br>The Blockchain is the very principle by which Bitcoin is viable. In effect, this technology should be seen as a digital "ledger", immutable and unfalsifiable. To do this, the blockchain constantly uses the computing power made available by Bitcoin users to secure transactions. In addition, the fact that all transactions are open source, i.e. can be consulted by anyone, is an aspect that makes the blockchain even more secure, so that the data is verified and verifiable. This transparency of the Blockchain is the essence of the trust given to this technology.

Although this use tends to develop, it is still very much in the minority, especially because of the strong fluctuations that Bitcoin can experience in a short period of time.

                        <p class="about__description"> <br> It is not possible to understand how Bitcoin works without understanding Bitcoin mining. A miner is a natural person who makes computing power available to the Bitcoin network to secure transactions. In exchange for this provision, the miner is rewarded with a commission in Bitcoin. Nowadays, Bitcoin is largely industrialized, and this is due to the fact that for mining to be profitable, it requires expensive facilities that are not available to everyone. Mining is an imperative component of the Bitcoin project, without a miner the network is not secure. Thanks to the miner, the creation of Bitcoin money is possible.

                        <p class="about__description">Because Bitcoin is a purely virtual currency and is not controlled by central banks or states, its money creation is also different. The latter is intimately linked to mining, and once you understand it, it is easier to understand Bitcoin's money creation. To reach the 21,000,000 Bitcoin units, which is the predefined quantity of Bitcoin, new Bitcoin are uploaded every 10 minutes and are paid to the miner as a commission. In the first version, about 50 Bitcoins were uploaded every 10 minutes. But in order to keep the creation of Bitcoin money as efficient as possible, it was decided that the number of Bitcoins uploaded every 10 minutes would be divided by 2 for each update. If in 2009, 50 Bitcoins were uploaded every 10 minutes, since the last version on May 11, 2020 only 6.25 Bitcoins are created every 10 minutes. The next version is expected to be implemented in 2024, which means that to reach the 21,000,000 Bitcoins created it will take until 2140.

                        <p class="about__description"> <br> As far as investment is concerned, Bitcoin has experienced a strong growth in recent years, as said earlier this currency is still not widely used for the purchase of goods or services. It is often compared to gold, a digital gold, and it is true that some similarities can be observed between gold and Bitcoin. Like gold, Bitcoin can be a safe haven as there is no devaluation due to inflation and it is present in limited quantities. But unlike gold, Bitcoin has a much higher volatility. Moreover, as it is not subject to any regulation, it can be the object of numerous speculations. An example of this is the fact that during 2017, Bitcoin doubled its value only to lose 80% of its value the following year and fall back below $3,000. One of the most common criticisms of Bitcoin is that it has no value, it is only a digital creation that is not linked to a physical value like gold or a commodity. However, just the principle of blockchain has a value of its own.

                        <p class="about__description">The value of crypto-currencies (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) is not solely related to their scarcity. While this is a significant component when it comes to Bitcoin, it is not the mechanism that makes it valuable. The real value of Bitcoin is in the technology it represents. It is the value of a totally decentralized system, with no managers or intermediaries. A system that allows for secure transactions from one end to the other. The value of Bitcoin is therefore not only the result of speculation, blockchain technology or its scarcity, but of a set of characteristics that make it a formidable technological innovation, which is briefly summarized here. In the end, we can consider that one Bitcoin represents only a fraction of the value of this network, and that at $30,000 per unit, it is not at all expensive.
