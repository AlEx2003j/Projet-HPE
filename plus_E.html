Indeed its value changes according to supply and demand. Its demand must be higher than its supply for its price to be high. Speculation therefore plays a key role in its value.  </p>

                        <p class="about__description"> Speculation is the act of buying an asset with a view to making a profit from its subsequent resale. To explain it is like making a bet on an object, on an event that may or may not happen. You have bought your bet (object, event). If your bet wins and you have guessed what will happen then your asset will be worth more than when you bought it. The difference in price between when you bought it and the current price is the money you have made or lost if you sell it. <br> 
                            The difference between items that may have a purely factual value, a utility - the vast majority of bitcoin buyers do not buy it for a utilitarian purpose. </p>

                        <span class="section-subtitle about__initial"> Why is it so attractive to speculators ?  </span>
                        <p class="about__description">At first glance one might wonder why so many people invest in bitcoin, it is not pegged to a currency or gold and does not respond to any stock exchange organization.  
                            These features make it attractive because it is based on a new technology: the Blockchain.  
                            There are many blockchains, which are computer systems that can be accessed anywhere in the world. They allow the storage and exchange of value on the Internet without a centralized intermediary.  
                            They store bitcoins in the form of blockchains. Since bitcoins are complex strings of numbers, they store strings of numbers. People with a bitcoin wallet can sell bitcoins to each other. What makes the blockchain special is its control mode: anyone with a wallet can validate or not an operation of the blockchain (change, modification of a block) and its modifications are registered on a kind of register. This register can be accessed at any time by all these people.</p>

                        <p class="about__description">Risks of speculation. ct, bitcoin does not escape its risks. Indeed, there can be speculative bubbles (a sustained and self-sustaining increase in the gap between the price and the fundamental value of an asset) which can lead to crashes (a sudden drop in the price of an asset class).  
                            Bitcoin has experienced several crashes, notably in April 2021. At that time it lost almost 30% of its value and even went as low as half its value. 
                            What are the reasons for this crash? 
                            It is important to understand that even if bitcoin is independent and based on the blockchain, its value is not based on speculation. Indeed, it depends on real monetary policies, mainstream acceptance and media coverage. 
                            In 2021 the crash was partly due to a tweet from Elon Musk announcing that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoins because of its environmental cost, but also because Chinese monetary authorities had highlighted its speculative nature. </p>

This is already the case, and political actors could be tempted to encourage their emergence, using every conceivable lever, in order to reduce the role of bitcoin, or even make it obsolete.
